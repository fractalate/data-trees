VALUE,ABBR,MEANING,RETIRED
1,Forest land,Forest land - Land meeting the Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) definition of forest land and is not used for any conflicting purpose. Such land is simply used to maintain forest cover in a natural state.,N
100,Agriculture,"Agricultural land - Land managed for crops, pasture, or other agricultural use. The area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide (with the exception of windbreak/shelterbelt, which has no minimum width and can be less than an acre). If a windbreak or shelterbelt qualifies and meets the definition of accessible forest land, then it is not considered nonforest. Use the 100 code only for cases not better described by one of the following:",N
110,Cropland,Cropland - Land utilized for agricultural crops including silage and feed grains; and bare farm fields resulting from cultivation or harvest.,N
120,Pasture,"Pasture (improved through cultural practices) - Land maintained and used for grazing with canopy cover less than 10 percent in live trees
(established seedlings, saplings or larger trees). Evidence of maintenance, besides the degree of grazing, includes condition of
fencing, presence of stock ponds or water tanks. Land also may be periodically brush hogged indicated by seedlings 3 to 4 feet in height and basal scars present on trees.",N
130,IdleFarmland,"Idle farmland - Former cropland or pasture that has not been tended within the last 2 years and that has less than 10 percent canopy cover with live trees, (established seedlings or larger trees) regardless of species. A field that is between crop rotations should NOT be called Idle Farmland",N
140,Orchard,Orchard / Nursery - Land utilized for orchards and nursery stock,N
150,ChristmasPlantation,Christmas tree plantation,N
160,WildlifeOpening,Maintained wildlife opening - Land maintained as a permanent opening of primarily herbaceous vegetation within woodland areas to provide food and cover benefits for early successional wildlife species. [Source: USDA NRCS] These may be located on public or private land.,N
170,Windbreak,"Windbreaks or shelterbelts are plantings of single or multiple rows of trees or shrubs that are established for environmental purposes. Windbreaks or shelterbelts are generally established to protect or shelter nearby leeward areas from troublesome winds. Such plantings are used to reduce wind erosion, protect growing plants (crops and forage), manage snow, and improve irrigation efficiency. Windbreaks also protect structures and livestock, provide wildlife habitat, improve aesthetics, and provide tree or shrub products. Also, when used as a living screen, windbreaks control views and lessen noise. [Source: USDA NRCS, Windbreak /Shelterbelt Conservation Practice Job Sheet 380, April 1997] This code is a subdivision of the Agriculture land use (100) and should only be coded when located within or directly adjacent to agricultural land. It should not be used to define similar features located within urban / developed areas that are not directly adjacent to agricultural lands. Such lands should be considered a part of the green space associated with the developed land use. A widely spaced row of trees located in a maintained area within a developed land use adjacent to agricultural lands is considered part of the developed condition due to both the spacing and the maintenance observed between the trees.",N
200,Rangeland,"Rangeland - Land primarily composed of grasses, forbs, or shrubs. This includes lands vegetated naturally or artificially to provide a plant cover managed
like native vegetation and does not meet the definition of pasture. The area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide.",N
300,Developed,"Developed - Land used primarily by humans for purposes other than forestry or agriculture. There is no specific minimum size requirement for the 300 (Developed) series of codes except that their shortest dimension must be at least 20 ft. in length. Exceptions to this rule are code 340 (Mining and Wasteland) which must be at least 120 ft. wide and an acre in size and codes 320 (Rights-of-way), 321 (Transportation), 322 (Utility), and linear sections of Parks contained developed trails 331 (Park) which have no minimum width. In some cases assign the land use that produces the most pedestrian ""foot traffic"".  Use the 300 code only for land not better described by one of the following:",N
310,Cultural,"Cultural: business (industrial/commercial), residential, and other places of intense human activity. Use the 310 code only for land not better described by one of the following:",N
311,Residential,Residential: Free standing structures and related green space/hardscape serving one to four families each.,N
312,Multi-family,"Multi-family residential: Structures containing more than four units each. A block of attached one-four family structures would be considered Multi-family residential. A residential complex consisting of many separate one-four family structure (analogous to an apartment complex) and related green space/hardscape would be also considered Multi-family residential. Residential complexes are described as a group of well-defined units with shared common areas such as green space, recreation, parking, and or other services. They may be a group of rental units or part of an inclusive single development.  Homeowners associations and gated communities are NOT to be considered residential complexes.",N
313,Institutional,"Institutional: Schools, hospitals/medical complexes, colleges, religious buildings, government buildings, etc., and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained).",N
314,Commercial,"Commercial/Industrial: In addition to standard commercial and industrial land uses associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained), outdoor storage/staging areas, and parking lots in downtown areas that are not connected with institutional or residential use are also included. Home businesses, such as day care, tax preparation, hair styling, etc. that are run out of Residential buildings are considered Commercial.",N
316,Cemetery,"Cemetery. This category includes associated access roads, buildings and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) while excluding obvious public roads which would be considered Rights-of-Ways.",N
320,Rights-of-way,"Rights-of-way: improved roads, maintained canal. • An improved road that specifically serves a Developed area such as a residence, parking lot, campground, or a cemetery is considered a part of that greater Developed NFLU, and is not delineated as a Right-of-Way so long as it remains within that Developed land use. Once that road departs from the specific Developed land use, it may be considered a Right-of-Way. Improved roads that are adjacent to Developed Nonforest areas, but do not uniquely serve those areas are considered rights-of-way and are not incorporated into the greater Developed condition. unless it’s bounded (on both sides) by accessible forest land. • An alley or alleyway is NOT delineated and mapped as a R.O.W. and is included in its surrounding condition. An alley is defined as a narrow lane, path, or passage way, for pedestrians or vehicles, which usually runs between or behind buildings, and in some cases provides access to the rear of lots or buildings. If the alley serves more than one UNFLU, lump it with the one that PC is closest to. Consider the area between the road edge and the far side of the sidewalk as part of the R.O.W. In cases where there is no sidewalk present look to the following ranked locations to determine the R.O.W. boundary: 1. Signs of periodic vegetation manipulation associated with the roadway 2. A clear change in ownership between public and private 3. The far side the drainage ditch associated with the road",N
321,Transportation,"Transportation: limited access roadway (highways with on-off ramps) and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) such as rest areas, railway or airport.",N
322,Utility,"Utility: power lines, pipelines, maintained levees and flood control channels",N
330,Recreation,"Recreation: Skiing, campgrounds, playing fields, athletic, sports tracks, etc. and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained).These are areas where persons participate in sports and outdoor activities. This code excludes complexes such as professional football stadiums, such areas would be considered Commercial / Industrial. Use code 330 for land not better described by the following:",N
331,Park,"Park: Parks are developed green space that are generally publicly owned and are always open to the public.  This land use generally consists of open maintained green space, playgrounds, recreational trails, buildings and/or athletic fields and includes associated parking areas and access roads. Related unmaintained woods that do NOT qualify as forest land and other areas that can not stand alone as a separate UNFLU will be treated as an inclusion in the park. Obvious public roads that do not exclusively serve the park should be considered Rights-of-Ways and mapped as a separate condition. Ownership by a parks department or other public agency does not, by itself, determine the UNFLU to be 331. Maintenance or development as described above must be present. Developed recreational trails running through narrow corridors that would have otherwise been considered inclusions in the surrounding condition serve as the evidence necessary to call such areas Parks as opposed to inclusions.",N
332,GolfCourse,"Golf courses. This category includes associated access roads, buildings and associated green space/hardscape (maintained and unmaintained) while excluding obvious public roads which would be considered Rights-of-Ways.",N
340,MiningWasteland,"Mining and wasteland
Note: Code 340 must be at least 1 acre in size and 120.0 feet in width.
Surface mining, gravel pits, dumps, landfills or reclaimed mining areas that are at least 1 acre and 120.0 feet in width. Note: Reclaimed mining areas are not always nonforest. Some trees such as black locust readily adapt to reclaimed areas. If the 10 %canopy cover requirement is met, the land is considered forest land. The field crew will make the decision of whether the land is productive or unproductive. Reclaimed mine areas should remain in this land use until either the 10% canopy cover threshold is met for accessible forest land or another nonforest land use applies.",N
400,Other,"Other - Land parcels greater than 1.0 acre in size and greater than 120.0 feet wide, which do not fall into one of the uses described above. At times a URBAN CONDITION CLASS STATUS 2 condition may be made up of multiple nonforest land uses, some of which may not meet defined size requirements. In this case record the first nonforest land use that you encounter, regardless of size. Examples include undeveloped beaches, barren land (rock, sand), marshes, bogs, ice, and snow. Do not use this code for areas that can be considerd associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) within the devloped series (300) land uses. Use the 400 code only for cases not better described by one of the following:",N
410,Nonvegetated,Nonvegetated,N
420,Wetland,"Wetland - Areas subjected to periodic tidal flooding or other areas where water is present for extended periods during the growing season and for longer periods during the non-growing season. Water usually comes from rainfall, snowmelt, a rising water table, groundwater seepage, or incoming tides. Water may be present on the surface of wetlands for varying periods, as in flooded or ponded wetlands, or it may simply keep the underlying soils saturated near the surface with no surface water present. Wetlands include bogs, marshes, salt marshes, swamps, meadows and fens. [Source: Tiner]
Bogs are not always nonforest. Some tree species such as black spruce can adapt to bog conditions. If the 10% canopy cover requirement is met, the land is considered forest land. The decision as to whether the land is productive or unproductive will be made by the field crews.
Swamps are not always nonforest. Some tree species readily adapt to the swamp conditions. If the 10% canopy cover requirement is met, the land is considered forest land. The decision of whether the land is productive or unproductive will be made by the field crews. Drained beaver ponds that are not stocked are included in this category.",N
430,Beach,Beach - Sandy or pebbly shore associated with an ocean or lake.,N

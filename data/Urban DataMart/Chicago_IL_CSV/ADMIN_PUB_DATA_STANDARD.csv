FIA Urban,3,This standard introduces estimates at the mother tree level for both Timber and Wooland-classifed species. This standard also fully populates the FIA Non-forest land use variable on conditions.,2019-08-06 12:55:37,2020-07-28 08:41:40,N,0001-01-01 00:00:00,2021-09-03 23:57:00
FIA Urban,4,"This standard incorporates invasive species sampling at the condition frequency. It also introduces iTree compilations as STANDARD, rather than EXTERNAL, compilations within a compilation group.",2020-07-28 08:41:40,2021-09-03 23:57:00,N,0001-01-01 00:00:00,2021-09-03 23:57:00
FIA Urban,5,The standard includes updates to field data. The LAND_COVER_CLASS attribute was replaced with a revised COVER_CLASS attribute. The species list was also revised. 42 species were removed from the list becuase they had an existing synonym. Any of these species tallied by the field crews were recoded to the approved synonym. There were no changes to compilation logic.,2021-09-03 23:57:00,2022-01-06 00:00:00,N,2021-09-03 23:57:00,2022-01-06 10:20:28
FIA Urban,6,This standard incorporates new compilation logic with the latest Field Data Standard to create a new Publication Data Standard. The new compilation logic adds collapsing logic on land use codes in support of FIA plot security policy.,2022-01-06 00:00:00,2022-05-20 00:00:00,N,2022-01-06 10:20:28,2022-05-20 12:50:38
FIA Urban,8,"This standard incorporates new compilation logic with Field Data Standard 4.3 to create a new Publication Data Standard. The new compilations include the latest iTree version, logic for FIA boundary calculations, and support for the new mother tree and stem table structure, as well as change matrix.",2023-04-11 00:00:00,2023-09-06 00:00:00,N,2023-04-12 07:09:25,2023-09-06 10:07:29
FIA Urban,7,"This standard incorporates new compilation logic with the latest Field Data Standard to create a new Publication Data Standard. The new compilation logic includes a correction to the COND_FIA_LANDUSE compilation, and a standing_dead_code operation in the MTRE_CALCULATIONS compilation.",2022-05-20 00:00:00,2023-04-11 00:00:00,N,2022-05-20 12:50:38,2023-04-12 07:09:25
FIA Urban,9,"This standard incorporates new compilation logic with the latest Field Data Standard to create a new Publication Data Standard. The compiled data standard includes NSVB logic, as well as logic to estimate the average crown width of a tree.",2023-09-06 00:00:00,2024-12-05 00:00:00,N,2023-09-06 10:07:29,2024-12-05 07:40:43
FIA Urban,10,This publication data standard is the first to allow for publication of iTree estimates at the tree level that were previously only at the estimation unit level.,2024-12-05 00:00:00,9999-12-31 00:00:00,Y,2024-12-05 07:40:43,2025-05-08 07:27:43

1,Open grown,"Open Grown – trees with crowns that received full light from above and from all sides throughout most of its life, particularly during its early developmental period.",N
2,Dominant,"Dominant – trees with crown extending above the general level of the crown canopy and receiving full light from above and partly from the sides. These trees are taller than the average trees in the stand and their crowns are well developed, but they could be somewhat crowded on the sides. Also, trees whose crowns have received full light from above and from all sides during early development and most of their life. Their crown form or shape appears to be free of influence from neighboring trees.",N
3,Co-dominant,"Co-dominant – trees with crowns at the general level of the crown canopy. Crowns receive full light from above but little direct sunlight penetrates their sides. Usually they have medium-sized crowns and are somewhat crowded from the sides. In stagnated stands, co-dominant trees have small-sized crowns and are crowded on the sides.",N
4,Intermediate,"Intermediate – trees that are shorter than dominants and co-dominant, but their crowns extend into the canopy of co-dominant and dominant trees. They receive little direct light from above and none from the sides. As a result, intermediate trees usually have small crowns and are very crowded from the sides.",N
5,Overtopped,Overtopped – trees with crowns entirely below the general level of the crown canopy that receive no direct sunlight either from above or the sides.,N

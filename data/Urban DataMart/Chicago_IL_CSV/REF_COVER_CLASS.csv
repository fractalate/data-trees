VALUE,ABBR,MEANING,RETIRED
1,Tree Cover,"Tree Cover: Areas on which live trees provide 10% or greater canopycover and are part of the dominant (uppermost) vegetation layer, including areas that have been planted to produce woody crops.",N
10,Water,"Water: Areas persistently covered and predominated by water and have <10% emergent vegetative cover. Examples include census and noncensus water and permanent snow and ice. For example, only the open water portion of a bog is to be included.",N
2,Shrub Cover,"Shrub Cover: Areas on which live shrubs or subshrubs provide 10% or greater cover and are part of the dominant (uppermost) vegetation layer, provided these areas do not qualify as TreeCover. Shrub/Subshrub —a woody plant that generally has several erect, spreading, or prostrate stems which give it a bushy appearance. This includes dwarf shrubs, and low or short woody vines (NVCS 2008) and excludes any species on FIA’s tree list. Examples include cranberry bogs, berry crops,and other shrub-dominated wetlands, chaparral, and sagebrush.",N
3,Herbaceous Cover,"Herbaceous Cover: Areas on which live herbaceous vegetation (including seasonally senescent cover) provides10% or greater cover and are part of the dominant (uppermost) vegetation layer, provided these areas do not qualify as TreeCover or ShrubCover.",N
4,Non-vascular Vegetation Cover,"Non-vascular Vegetation Cover: Areas on which non-vascular vegetation provide 10% or greater cover and are part of the dominant vegetation layer, provided these areas do not qualify as TreeCover, ShrubCover, or Herbaceous Cover. Examples include mosses, sphagnum moss bogs, liverworts, hornworts, lichens, and algae.",N
5,Mixed Vegetation Cover,"Mixed Vegetation Cover: Areas with 10% or greater live vegetative cover but no one life form has 10% or more cover. That is, these areas do not qualify as TreeCover, ShrubCover, Herbaceous Cover, or Non-vascular VegetationCover, and thus are a mixture of plant life forms. Examples can include early stages of reverting fields and high deserts.",N
8,Barren,"Barren: Areas predominately covered by bare rock, gravel, sand, silt, clay, or other earthen material, which contains <10% vegetation cover regardless of its inherent ability to support life.",N
9,Impervious,"Impervious: Areas predominantly covered with constructed materials that contain < 10% vegetation cover. Examples include paved roads, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, rooftops and other man-made structures.",N

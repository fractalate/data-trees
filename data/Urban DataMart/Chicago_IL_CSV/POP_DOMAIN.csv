FIA Forest Land (Stocking),"Land within the population of interest that is accessible and meets the following critera. It must be at least 10% stocked by trees of any size or has been at least 10% stocked in the past Or, if stocked by woodland species where stocking cannot be determined, the condition must have at least 5% crown cover by trees of any size or has had at least 5% crown cover in the past. . It is not subject to nonforest uses that prevent normal tree regenration and succession (regular mowing, intensive grazing, recreation). It must be at least 1.0 acres in size and at least 120.0 feet wide measured steam-to-stem from the outer-most edge.

It must have at least 10% canopy cover of live tally tree species of any size or has had at least 10% canopy cover in the past, based on presence of stumpts, snags, or other evidence. It must not be subject to nonforest uses that prevent normal tree regeneration and succession (regular mowing, intensive grazing, recreation activities).

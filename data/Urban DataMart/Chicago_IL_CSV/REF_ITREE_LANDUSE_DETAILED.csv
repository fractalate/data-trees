VALUE,ABBR,MEANING,RETIRED
10,Agriculture,"Agriculture: Is defined as cropland, pasture, idle farmland, orchards, vineyards, nurseries, maintained wildlife openings, farmsteads and related buildings, feed lots, rangeland, and includes windbreaks and shelterbelts that do not meet the definition for forest land. Wooded areas /plantations that are managed for a specific crop such as nuts or Christmas trees or forest land that shows obvious evidence of management activity related specifically to wood production are also included. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE:100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160,170,200, 320 and CONDITION CLASS STATUS = 1 (accessible forest land) conditions that are are managed for wood production and not reserved.",N
20,Residential,"Residential: Free standing structures and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) serving a single independent housing unit. Such units (normally with a single family) include fully detached, semidetached (semiattached, side-by-side), row houses, and townhouses. In the case of attached units, each must be separated from the adjacent unit by a ground-to-roof wall (completely walled off from other units, without any common space) in order to be classified as a single-family structure. Also, these units must not share heating/air-conditioning systems or utilities.  Units built one on top of another and those built side-by-side that do not have a ground-to-roof wall (a clear divider between units eliminating any potential for common space) and/or have common facilities (i.e., shared attic, basement, heating plant, plumbing, etc.) are not included in the single-family statistics. When the presences or absence of shared common space is not clearly visible look for evidence of separate utilities to determine if it is a single independent housing unit.  This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 311 and 320",N
21,Multi-family,"Multi-family residential: Residential buildings containing units built one on top of another AND those built side-by-side which may have common space due to the lack of a ground-to-roof wall (clear divider between units to prevent common space) and/or have common facilities (i.e., attic, basement, heating plant, plumbing, etc.) and their associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained). This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 312 and 320",N
22,Institutional,"Institutional: Schools, hospitals/medical complexes, colleges, religious buildings, government buildings, etc., and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained). This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 313, 320 and 340.  [Note: If a parcel contains large unmaintained areas, possibly for expansion or other reasons, treat the area as Unused (i-TREE LAND USE 24). However, small islands of trees in a maintained landscape would be considered Institutional.]",N
23,Commercial,"Commercial/Industrial: In addition to standard commercial and industrial land uses and their associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained), this category includes outdoor storage/staging areas as well as parking lots in downtown areas that are not connected with an institutional or residential use. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 314, 320 and 340. NOTE: For mixed-use buildings, land use is based on the dominant use, i.e., the use that receives the majority of the foot traffic. It might not always occupy the majority of space in the building. For example, a building with commercial use of the first floor and apartments on upper floors would be classified as Commercial/Industrial.",N
24,Unused,"Unused: This category includes land with no clear intended present or past use. An empty lot where  its associated structures have been removed should be called unused. Abandoned buildings, vacant structures, and their associated infrastructure and green space/hardscape should be classified based on their original intended use. For example, an overgrown parking lot and playground associated with an abandoned apartment complex would be classified as Multi-family Residential, not Unused. Idle farmland should be classified as Agriculture. Forest land that is not clearly actively managed for timber production and is not contained within the boundaries of a Park, Golf course, or Cemetery land use would be coded as Unused. For example forest land in the form of a woodlot in the middle of a corn field that is not being managed for wood products would be considered Unused, as the land is not associated with a particular land use. Forest land contained within the boundaries of a Park, Golf Course, or Cemetery would be coded respectively. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 300, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 320, 410, 430, 450 and CONDITION CLASS STATUS = 1 (accessible forest land) conditions that are not managed for wood production or part of a Park, Cemetery, or Golf Course.",N
25,Cemetery,"Cemetery: Includes associated access roads, buildings, associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained), and forest land within the Cemetery boundary that is not being managed for wood products. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 316, 320, and CONDITION CLASS STATUS = 1 (accessible forest land) conditions that are not managed for wood production or part of a Park or Golf Course.",N
30,Transportation,"Transportation: Includes limited access roadways and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) (such as interstate highways with on and off ramps, sometimes fenced); railroad stations, tracks and yards; shipyards; airports; etc. If plot falls on any other type of road, or associated median strip, classify according to nearest adjacent land use. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 320 and 321.",N
31,Utility,"Utility: Power-generating facilities, sewage treatment facilities, covered and uncovered reservoirs, empty storm-water runoff retention areas, flood control channels, conduits, and associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained).. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 314, 320 and 322.",N
40,Park,"Park: The PARK i-Tree code differs slightly from the PARKS UNFLU code in that the i-Tree code may be used to describe both non-forest conditions as well as forested conditions that are not being managed for wood products. Non-Forest parks are developed green space that are generally publicly owned and are always open to the public. These areas generally consist of open maintained green space, playgrounds, recreational trails, buildings and/or athletic fields and include associated parking areas and access roads. Forested parks take on many forms but normally include “park”, “wilderness,” “wild river,” “reserve,” or “preserve” in their names, are normally publicly owned and are generally open to the public although they may be closed for resource protection or public safety reasons. The i-Tree Park land use is based on the condition UNFLU, not the actual park boundary. For example, a wetland (UNFLU 420) within the park boundaries would receive an i-Tree land use of 50 NOT 40. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 320, 330,331, and CONDITION CLASS STATUS = 1 (accessible forest land) conditions that are not managed for wood production or part of a Cemetery or Golf Course. When Condition Status = 1 and RESERVE=1, i-Tree must equal 40.",N
41,Golf Course,"Golf Course: Includes associated access roads, buildings, associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained), and forest land within the Golf Course boundary that is not being managed for wood products. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 320, 332 and CONDITION CLASS STATUS = 1 (accessible forest land) conditions that are not managed for wood production or part of a Park or Cemetery.",N
50,Water,"Water/wetland: Streams, rivers, lakes, storm-water retention areas and other water bodies / wetlands (natural or manmade) that meet the definition of URBAN CONDITION CLASS STATUS 3 or 4 or areas meeting the definition of URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 420.",N
60,Other,"Other: Land uses that are not better described by one of the categories listed above. This designation should be used very sparingly as it provides very little useful information for the model. Clarify with comments in Notes. Do not use this code for areas that can be considerd associated green space/hardscape (maintained or unmaintained) within the devloped UNFU series (300) land uses. This code is valid with URBAN NONFOREST LAND USE 300, 310, 320, and 400.",N

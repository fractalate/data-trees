VALUE,ABBR,MEANING,RETIRED
1,Ingrowth,Ingrowth –either a new tally tree not qualifying as through growth or a new tree on land that was formerly nonforest and now qualifies as forest land (reversion or encroachment).,N
2,Through growth,"Through growth – new tally tree 5.0 inches DBH/DRC and larger, within the microplot, which was not missed at the previous inventory (i.e., grew from seedling to pole size between inventory cycles). This code would be used for trees that were transplanted to the site and had a DBH/DRC of 5” or greater.",N
5,Shrank,Shrank – live tree that shrank below threshold diameter on microplot/subplot.,N
6,Physical movement,"Physical movement – tree was either (a) correctly tallied in previous inventory, but has now moved beyond the radius of the plot due to natural causes (e.g., small earth movement, hurricane), or (b) outside the radius of the plot previously, but has now moved within the plot due to natural causes. Tree must be either live before and still alive now, or dead before and dead now. If tree was live before and now dead, this is a mortality tree and should have PRESENT TREE STATUS = 2 (not 0).",N
7,Cruiser error,"Cruiser error – tree was either (a) erroneously tallied (added tree), or (b) erroneously not tallied (missed tree) at the previous inventory.",N
8,Procedural change,"Procedural change – tree either (a) was tallied at the previous inventory, but is no longer tallied due to a definition or procedural change or (b) was not tallied at the previous inventory, but is now tallied due to a definition or procedural change.",N
9,Nonsampled area,"Nonsampled area - tree either (a) was located in a sampled condition at the previous inventory but now is in a nonsampled condition, or (b) the area where the tree is located was previously not sampled, but now is sampled. All trees located in a nonsampled area (either now or previously) have RECONCILE = 9.",N
